        "The Shortest Path Problem (SPP) involves finding the shortest path between two specific nodes in a weighted graph. In a graph, nodes represent points or locations, and edges represent connections between those points. A weighted graph includes numerical values associated with each edge, indicating the \"cost\" or \"weight\" of traveling between the connected nodes. The goal of the shortest path problem is to determine the path from a starting node to a target node that has the minimum total cost among all possible paths. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges along that path. Consider the following example:\n",

        "\n",
        "Tom is mindful of optimizing his energy expenditure, and he is aware of the limited distances he can cover each day. On the first day of travel, he can comfortably reach City \"B\", \"C\", or \"D\". On the second day, he can reach City \"E\", \"F\", or \"G\". Ultimately, Tom can reach his destination, City \"H\", on the third day.\n",
        "\n",
        "To conserve energy and navigate his journey efficiently, Tom must strategically decide where to spend each night along the route.

By skillfully selecting his overnight stops, Tom can ensure his expedition is both cost-effective and successful.\n",
